<h1>About us</h1>

<p>
	Since its founding in July 2023, <em>The Astrosky Ecosystem</em> has grown into a large open-source
	project with multiple volunteer developers and twelve volunteer moderators.
</p>

<p>
	We're proud to host feeds with nearly two thousand signed up users - including international space
	agencies and billion-dollar megatelescope projects.
</p>

<p>
	Most of all, we're excited for the future: a future in which science communication and discussion
	spaces can become safe, stable, and permanent.
