**We're delighted that, as of today, we've updated our website and naming for the project.**

Going forwards, the feeds and tools that we're working on will be known as *The Astrosky Ecosystem*. We wanted something that incorporated the wide range of tools that we're working on - and we felt that this was a perfect fit!

Additionally, our new website gives us a way to do things like...

* [List all of our available feeds](/feeds)
* [Provide signup instructions](/about/signup)
* Provide news & updates (like this one)
* ... and loads more that we have planned!

With **nearly two thousand signed up users** to the Astrosky feeds, future plans in the works to host user data, and more, we're excited for the next chapter of our project.
